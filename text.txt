2024-06-22 You've heard about quantum entangled particles, where I can create a pair of particles that know about one another, and now they separated in space and in time. And if you observe that other particle, it instantly changes the state of the particle back, the other particle that's back where I am. And by the way, they communicate instantaneously, faster than the speed of light. But when you say if you observe, but you have to do something, you have to do something that you have to do. Yes. The problem is the word observe. People think is a psychological thing, but in physics, it's got nothing to do with it. It's a measurement thing. Right. And so another one is measuring. If there is an electron sitting in the middle of this table, and all the lights are out, I can say, I think there's an electron here. Let me find out. And the moment I turn on the lights, the light interacts, a photon interacts with the electron and kicks it somewhere else. So the more I try to measure, it's positioned, the less I know it's positioned.
